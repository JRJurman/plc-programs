/* 8. Does your flightExists query give you the longest or shortest possible path? */
/* Can you explain how to make it do it the opposite way, if it is even possible? */
/* ANSWER: the clauses are tried in the order that they are written in, so it will give the shortest path first */
/* if fourStop was set as the first clause, that it would try that first, and then threeStop, and so on... */
